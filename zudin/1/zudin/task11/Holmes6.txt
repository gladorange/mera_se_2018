"Watson! I know the names of Openshaw's enemies! I'm going to send them a surprise! It will frighten them!"
"What do you mean?"
He had an orange in his hand. Holmes took out the pips and put five of them in a letter. On it he wrote:
Captain James Calhoun Sailing Ship "Lone Star", Georgia.
"And who is this captain?" I asked.
"He is the leader of these devils. I shall get the others too, but he is the first. I have spent all the day at the port of London and studied hundreds of the ship's papers. Only the 'Lone Star' was in the three ports at the right times, and this morning she left London to sail back to Georgia.There are three Americans on board, I also found out that all three of them were away from the ship last night. They are the killers."
"When they arrive in Georgia, the steamship will be there and the American police will get the other letter and get them."
Poor Sherlock Holmes! His plans came to nothing. He could do nothing about the weather. The winter storms were worse than ever, so the "Lone Star" never arrived in America. And the killers of John Openshaw never got the orange pips, but, in the end, death came to them.
