"He always laughed at my story of Elias and the five orange pips, but now he looked puzzled and even frightened.
'What does it mean, John?' he said in a low voice. His face was white.
'Look! There's K. K. K. on the letter,' he said. We were afraid.
'So the letter says. Here are the letters K. K. K. It also tells me to leave the papers in the garden. What papers?'
The papers in the Uncle Elias's box. But he burnt them!'
'Well, where does the letter come from? From Dundee in Scotland,' he said. 'Why do they write to me about papers?' said my father. ,     'You must tell the police.'
'No, they will laugh at me. Let's forget about it.'
"Three days later my father went to see his friend who lived some miles away. I thought he would be safer away from home. But I was wrong.
"On the second day I got a letter from his friend asking me to come at once. The police said that my father was walking home in the dark when he fell down a hill. He was badly hurt and died soon after. They decided it was an accident, but I didn't agree.
"But I was sure it was not. I thought it was a murder, and I couldn't forget the five orange pips and the strange letters to my uncle and my father.
"Now I was the one to own the house. I have lived alone in that house for nearly three years now. Then yesterday I got this."
"The young man showed us the letter with K.K.K. on it and five small orange pips inside.
"You see? It comes from London, and it says 'Leave the papers in the garden.' Those are the words that were in the letter to my father."
"What did you do next?" asked Holmes.
"Nothing," answered John. "I don't know what to do. I am too afraid."
